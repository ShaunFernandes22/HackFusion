## Introduction

Our project introduces a cutting-edge remote learning platform aimed at transforming the educational experience for students, instructors, and administrators. It addresses the challenges of remote learning such as lack of engagement, limited feedback mechanisms, and increasing demand for remote learning solutions.

## Approach

### Frontend
- Utilized React,Tailwind CSS,MUI,ChakraUI and other UI libraries for a responsive UI.
- Integrated ZegoCloud SDK for video calling functionality.
  
### Backend
- Implemented with Node.js and Express for server-side operations.
- MongoDB as the database.
- Integrated intelligent Emotion Analysis and Deep Face emotion recognition using DeepFace, Fastapi, Wor2vec2, and OpenCV.
